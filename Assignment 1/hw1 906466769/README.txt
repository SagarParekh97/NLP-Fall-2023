Run the following command to create a conda environment with the necessary packages

conda env create -f environment.yml

# activate the env
conda activate nlp_hw1_906466769

The best-performing models are provided in the ```hw1_model_906466769.zip``` file. Extract the zip file and run the python notebook ```hw1_906466769.ipynb```. The code will load the models from the folder. 

In order to train the network again, simply delete the saved model and run the python notebook.

The output of the python notebook during the training is also provided as a pdf, named hw1_906466769.pdf

The approach, hyperparameters, and results are reported in the hw1_906466769_Report.pdf
